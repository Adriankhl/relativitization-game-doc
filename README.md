# Relativitization game documentation
Everything about the [Relativitization](https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization) game.

## Is this a game for you?
This is a turn-based strategy / simulation game in 4D, relativistic spacetime.

If you want fancy graphics and musics, probably this is not the right place.
As a primarily one-man project, there aren't sufficient manpower and resources to work on that.

If you are curious to see how will things happen in a physically more realistic 
universe which respects relativity, or if you want to experiment your ideas in a FOSS game,
you should try this out.
