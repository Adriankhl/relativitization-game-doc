## Is this a game for you?

This is a turn-based strategy / simulation game in 4D, relativistic spacetime.

If you want fancy graphics and musics, this may not the right place. As a primarily one-man project, providing deep and
interesting mechanics has a higher priority.

If you are curious to see how interstellar civilizations should make their strategic decisions in a universe under the
Einstein's theory of special relativity, or if you want to experiment your ideas in a FOSS game, you should try this
out.
