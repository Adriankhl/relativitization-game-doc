The default settings will generate a universe and each player has one star initially. 
Here are the settings you should consider to tune:
* Total number of AI + human player: the initial number of player in the universe
* Universe name: use a new name for a new game to prevent overriding your other saved games
* Universe x dimension: the universe has 3 spatial dimension (x, y, z), this determines the maximum of x
* Universe y dimension: determine the maximum of y
* Universe z dimension: determine the maximum of z, it is recommended to set this to a small value since it is harder
to interpret the visualization of a universe with high z dimension in this game

The ideal size of the universe depends on the spec of your PC.
A reasonable suggestion is (x dimension = 10, y dimension = 10, z dimension = 3).

Next, you can press the "Generate button", it may take a while to generate the universe.
